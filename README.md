# Gemini Schedule Demo üéì

A simple Node.js application that demonstrates how to use Google's Gemini API to create intelligent daily schedules for students. This demo shows how AI can help organize tasks and events into optimal time slots based on student preferences.

## What This Demo Does

This application:
1. **Loads student data** from a JSON file containing tasks, events, and preferences
2. **Sends the data to Gemini Flash 2.5** with instructions to create an optimal schedule
3. **Receives a structured schedule** organized into morning, afternoon, and evening time slots
4. **Displays the results** in a user-friendly format and saves them to a file

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (free to get at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

**Important:** The `config.json` file is not included in this repository for security reasons. You need to create it yourself.

**Step 1:** Copy the template file:
```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
```

**Step 2:** Edit `config.json` and add your API key:
```json
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

**To get your API key:**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key and paste it into `config.json`

### 3. Run the Application

You can run the application in two ways:

**Option 1: Using npm (recommended)**
```bash
npm start
```

**Option 2: Running the file directly**
```bash
node schedule.js
```

Both commands do the same thing! The application will load the sample student data and generate a schedule using Gemini AI.

## File Structure

```
gemini-schedule-demo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # Node.js dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json.template  # Template for API key configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json           # Your Gemini API key (create this from template)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ student-data.json     # Sample student data with tasks and preferences
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule.js           # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore           # Git ignore file (protects your API key)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This file
```

## Understanding the Code

### `student-data.json`
Contains sample data for a student named Alex Johnson, including:
- **Student preferences**: How they like to organize their day
- **Events list**: Tasks, classes, meals, and activities with categories and durations

### `schedule.js`
The main application that:
- Loads student data from the JSON file
- Creates a detailed prompt for Gemini AI
- Calls the Gemini API to generate a schedule
- Parses and displays the results

### Key Features for Students

- **Clear comments**: Every section is explained for learning
- **Error handling**: Shows helpful messages if something goes wrong
- **Structured output**: Results are organized and easy to read
- **File saving**: Generated schedules are saved for reference

## Sample Output

The application will generate a schedule like this:

```
üìÖ DAILY SCHEDULE
==================

üåÖ MORNING (6:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
--------------------------------
‚è∞ 7:00 AM - morning run
   Category: exercise | Duration: 30 minutes

‚è∞ 8:00 AM - breakfast
   Category: meal | Duration: 20 minutes

‚è∞ 10:00 AM - grocery shopping
   Category: errand | Duration: 45 minutes

‚òÄÔ∏è  AFTERNOON (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
----------------------------------
‚è∞ 12:00 PM - lunch
   Category: meal | Duration: 30 minutes

‚è∞ 2:30 PM - CS 6104 lecture at 2:30pm
   Category: class | Duration: 75 minutes

‚è∞ 4:00 PM - study for math exam
   Category: study | Duration: 2 hours

üåô EVENING (6:00 PM - 11:00 PM)
-------------------------------
‚è∞ 6:00 PM - dinner with jane and joe
   Category: social | Duration: 90 minutes

‚è∞ 8:00 PM - group project meeting
   Category: study | Duration: 90 minutes
```

## Customizing the Data

To use your own student data:

1. **Edit `student-data.json`**:
   - Change the student name
   - Update the preferences paragraph
   - Modify the events list with your own tasks

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   node schedule.js
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not load config.json"
- Make sure you've created `config.json` with your API key
- Check that the JSON format is correct (no extra commas, proper quotes)

### "Error calling Gemini API"
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you have API access enabled in Google AI Studio

### "No JSON found in response"
- This sometimes happens if Gemini returns extra text
- The raw response will be displayed so you can see what went wrong

## Learning Objectives

This demo teaches:
- **API Integration**: How to connect to external AI services
- **JSON Processing**: Reading and writing structured data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management
- **Prompt Engineering**: How to ask AI for specific output formats
- **Node.js Basics**: File system operations, async programming

## Next Steps

Try modifying the code to:
- Add more detailed time preferences
- Include location information for events
- Generate weekly schedules instead of daily
- Add conflict detection for overlapping events
- Create a web interface for easier interaction
