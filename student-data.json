    "preferences": "I prefer to exercise in the morning to start my day energized. I like to have meals at regular times - breakfast around 8am, lunch around 12pm, and dinner around 6pm. I study best in quiet environments during afternoon hours when I'm most focused. I enjoy social activities in the evening to unwind after classes."
